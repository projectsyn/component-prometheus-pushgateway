= Alert rule: PushgatewayDown

== icon:glasses[] Overview

This rule checks if the Prometheus push gateway pod is up by checking whether Prometheus can currently scrape the push gateway pod's metrics endpoint.

== icon:bug[] Steps for Debugging

Check why the push gateway pod is down.
Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`, `kubectl events`, or `kubectl describe deploy <deployment-name>` to investigate.

If the pod appears to be running fine, check if you can reach the push gateway pod from the Prometheus pod/namespace:

[source,bash]
----
# in the Prometheus pod (or another pod in the Prometheus namespace)
wget -O- http://<pod ip>:9091/metrics
----

If the `wget` command fails, investigate whether there's `NetworkPolicy` objects that prohibit Prometheus from accessing the push gateway pod.
